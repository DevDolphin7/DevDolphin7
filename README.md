👋 __Hi!__

I'm Dan Olver 🚀 (he/him/they)

I'm just getting started in professional software development after years spent mucking around with the raspberry pi in python 🐍

I've completed a Full-Stack JavaScript Development bootcamp with Northcoders and worked with them on a fixed term contract ☕

I'm currently learning C# as well as increasing my experience in DevOps! ⏫

You can reach me at:

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-olver-595b9b311/)

Fun fact: In a conversation I am known to bust out _"fun facts with Dan: not always fun, not always facts"_ - I like to keep them guessing 🔍
